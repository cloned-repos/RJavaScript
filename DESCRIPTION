Package: RJavaScript
Version: 0.1-0
Title: Tools for programming JavaScript using the R syntax
Description: This is package that attempts to convert R code
  to JavaScript code. The idea is that we can use this when
   we are creating content for Web browsers or Flash applications
   within R.  JavaScript is becoming increasingly important and relevant
   for creating dynamic, interactive content for the Web and so how we present
   statistical results.
   RJSONIO allows us to export R data objects to JavaScript
   so that we can use those objects within JavaScript functions.
   This package attempts to allow R programmers to use the familiar
   R syntax to create JavaScript code. The R code should refer to 
   JavaScript classes and methods and not other R code.
   It is possible that we may be able to use this package to 
   export the implementation of some R functions to JavaScript.
   However, this is likely to be imited.
   If you are familiar with JavaScript and can program reasonably easily
   with that language, you will probably be better off writing the code
   directly in JavaScript rather than using this translator.
